## About ImageKit

[ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/) is an intelligent real-time image optimization and transformation service with a global delivery network. Its service is similar to imgix and Cloudinary. ImageKit offers a generous [Forever Free Plan](https://imagekit.io/plans) with up to 20GB bandwidth per month. I highly recommend checking it out!
